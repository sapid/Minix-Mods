proc.c => /usr/src/kernel/proc.c
   The relevant functions to look at here are sched() and pick_proc()
      Also maybe enqueue() and dequeue()
proc.h => /usr/src/kernel/proc.h
   Modifying the proc structure here may be necessary.
resource.c => /usr/include/sys/resource.h
   PRIO_MIN and PRIO_MAX may need to be modified.
misc.c => /usr/include/servers/pm/misc.c
   do_getsetpriority() sets process priority.
      This calls do_nice() in system.c
   Alternatively, just call nice() which calls do_nice() directly.
system.c => /usr/include/kernel/system.c
   Contains do_nice(). Probably needs to be rewritten.
longrun.c
   This is simply a program that will loop forever without CPU optimization.

The current MINIX scheduler is pretty simply. It maintains 16 queues of "ready" processes (0-15). 0 is highest priority; 15 is lowest and contains only IDLE. Processes have a max priority.

Add 3 queues (0-18) and use the bottom 3 for user processes.
   A system process has SYS_PROC bit set in the process's flag variable.


Lottery Scheduling
------------------
System processes use the original algorithm; (0-15) remain untouched.
Queue 16 holds all user processes - default for a new process is 5. Processes can add or subtract tickets by calling setpriority(ntickets) where ntickets < 101.
The scheduler generates a random number 0 to the sum of ntickets - 1. It then iterates through the ready queue until it hits zero or less, and runs that process.
srandom() will initialize the random number generator. random() may be used to fetch a random number.
Processes are created and initialized in /usr/src/kernel/system/do_fork.c... this is probably the best place to initialize any data structures.


Round-Robin Queues
------------------
Again, user processes will exist in queues 16-18.
Demotion from Queue 1: Complete 5 quanta.
Demotion from Queue 2: Complete 5 quanta.
Promotion to  Queue 1: Complete 10 quanta.

Running strategy:
Run all processes in Queue 1, then a process from Queue 2. Once all processes in Queue 2 have run, run a process from Queue 3.

Tip:
Have a pseudo-process that runs a process from the next queue when it's in front. (Make sure it can't move!)
